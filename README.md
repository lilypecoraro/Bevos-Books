<h2>About</h2>

Bevo’s Books is a student-built e-commerce web application created as part of UT Austin’s MIS 333K course. The project simulates a real-world online bookstore, allowing customers to browse products, manage carts, place orders, and leave reviews, while providing administrators with tools for inventory, pricing, promotions, and user management.

The application was developed with an emphasis on product thinking, systems design, and user experience, balancing technical feasibility with clear customer and business needs.

<h2>Goal and Requirements</h2>

The goal of this project was to design and deliver a production-style e-commerce platform from ideation through launch under realistic constraints.

Core requirements included:
- Translating user pain points into concrete product features
- Defining and prioritizing product requirements before implementation
- Building a secure, role-based system for customers and administrators
- Designing a normalized relational database to support orders, reviews, and inventory
- Implementing session-based cart functionality and order workflows
- Delivering a polished, intuitive UI suitable for non-technical users

To maintain focus on systems design and product logic, the project intentionally excluded third-party payment processing and external commerce APIs.
