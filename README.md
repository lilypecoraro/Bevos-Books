<h2>About</h2>

Bevo’s Books is a full-stack e-commerce bookstore built as part of a team-based web application project at The University of Texas at Austin. The site allows users to browse books, manage carts, place orders, and leave reviews, while administrators can manage inventory, pricing, promotions, and user roles.

The project was designed to simulate a realistic online retail platform, emphasizing both technical implementation and user experience. It balances backend logic, database design, authentication, and front-end usability in a single cohesive system.

<h2>Goal and Requirements</h2>

The primary goal of this project was to design and implement a production-style web application using ASP.NET Core MVC.

Key requirements included:
- Full CRUD functionality for products, orders, and users
- Secure authentication and role-based authorization
- A relational database with proper normalization
- Session-based cart management
- Admin-only tools for inventory and order management
- A polished, user-friendly interface

The project intentionally excluded external e-commerce APIs and third-party payment processing to keep the focus on core application logic and system design.

<h2>Key Learnings</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Designing relational databases to support real application workflows</li>
  <li>Implementing role-based access control with ASP.NET Identity</li>
  <li>Managing state using sessions in a web environment</li>
  <li>Balancing backend requirements with front-end usability</li>
  <li>Collaborating in a team using Git and GitHub</li>
</ul>

The project was iteratively improved throughout development based on testing, instructor feedback, and usability refinements.
